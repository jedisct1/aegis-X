  abstract = {Abstract In this paper, the security of Advanced Encryption Standard-based authenticated encryption schemes, including AEGIS family, Tiaoxin-346, and Rocca by mixed integer linear programming tools is examined. Specifically, for the initialisation phase of AEGIS, Tiaoxin-346, and Rocca, the security against differential attacks and integral attacks is evaluated by estimating the lower bounds for the number of active S-boxes and utilising division property, respectively. In addition to the estimations of initialisation phases, the security of the encryption phases of AEGIS, Tiaoxin-346, and Rocca against distinguishing attacks on keystream is evaluated by exploiting integral properties. As a result, the authors show that the initialisation phases of AEGIS-128/128L/256, Tiaoxin-346, and Rocca are secure against differential attacks after 4/3/6, 5, and 6 rounds, respectively. Regarding integral attacks, the distinguisher is found on 6/6/7, 15, and 7 rounds in the initialisation phases of AEGIS-128/128L/256, Tiaoxin-346, and Rocca, respectively. Additionally, the integral distinguisher is presented on 2/2/4, 4, and 4 rounds in the encryption phases of AEGIS-128/128L/256, Tiaoxin-346, and Rocca, respectively. As far as it is known, this studyâ€™s results are the first distinguishing attacks on the keystream on AEGIS, Tiaoxin-346, and Rocca without relying on weak keys.}
